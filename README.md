Hirst Spot Painting using Python Turtle Graphics

This project is an implementation of the famous Hirst Spot Painting using Python Turtle Graphics. The Hirst Spot Painting is a series of paintings created by the British artist Damien Hirst in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The paintings consist of rows and columns of colored spots, and each painting is unique.

    Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/GokulBakkiyarasu/Hirst_spot_painting_using_python.git
    Ensure that you have Python 3 installed.
    Install the turtle module, which is a standard Python library.
    Run python hirst_spot_painting.py to generate a new Hirst Spot Painting.

How to Use

    Each painting is unique and randomly generated.
    The program will prompt you to enter the number of dots you want to create for the painting.
    The dots will be arranged in a grid pattern.
    The color of each dot is randomly selected from a predetermined set of colors.
    The size of each dot is fixed.

Project Structure

    hirst_spot_painting.py - the main Python script for generating the Hirst Spot Painting.
    img.png - contains the image from where the colors for the painting are extracted that can be used for the dots.
