Hirst Spot Painting using Python

This project is an implementation of a Hirst Spot Painting using Python. The original artwork was created by the artist Damien Hirst, and consists of colorful dots arranged in a grid pattern.

To create the Hirst Spot Painting using Python, we use the colorgram library to extract color from an image an image and the random library to generate random colors for each dot. The program first prompts the user for the size of the painting and the size of the dots. It then creates a new image and fills it with random-colored dots arranged in a grid pattern.

The Hirst Spot Painting project is a great way to practice programming skills and explore the use of randomization in creating art. It can also be customized by changing the size of the painting or the colors of the dots.

To run the program, simply run the Python script and follow the prompts to specify the size of the painting and the size of the dots. The resulting image will be saved in the same directory as the script.

Overall, the Hirst Spot Painting project is a fun and creative way to explore the use of Python in creating art, and is a great example of the intersection between programming and the visual arts.
